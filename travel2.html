      <h2>Mirror Tree House, Sweden</h2>
      <p>Almost invisible and perfect for hiding, the Mirror House is part of the Tree Hotel project in the North of Sweden. As cool as it looks, weâ€™re afraid the house may be invisible to birds.</p>

      <h2>The Birds Nest Tree House, Sweden</h2>
      <p>This tree house, by the creators of the Tree Hotel, might confuse the birds even more. Although it looks like a massive nest from the outside, the house has a modern and high-standard room built inside. </p>
